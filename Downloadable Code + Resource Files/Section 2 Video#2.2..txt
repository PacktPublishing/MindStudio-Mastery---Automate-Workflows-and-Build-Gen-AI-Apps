Due to updates on the platform/app, the "Send Message" block is now divided into two blocks:

Generate Text: Sends a message prompt to the AI and returns the AI's response, which can be saved to a variable.
Display Text: Shows text to the user exactly as written and can use variables.

In the Email Funnel Generator Template example, both the first and second "Send Message" blocks will now be "Generate Text" blocks.

Additionally, the "functions section" now includes pre-built blocks accessible via an API key for users with access to this service.
