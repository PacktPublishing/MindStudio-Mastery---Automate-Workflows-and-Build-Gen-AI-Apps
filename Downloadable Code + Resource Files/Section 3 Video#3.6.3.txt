Section 3: Query data

In the video, I mentioned adding instructions in the query template, such as "Find me relevant information about...," as if I am directing an AI to scrape the vector database. 
However, please note that the block simply queries the datasource for semantic meaning, so adding these instructions doesn't help. 
You can test this by removing the extra instructions and running the workflow with and without them. 
The only important dynamic value in the query is the request itself, which the block uses to search the datasource for the best match.

Please also note that to get a better response to your query data, you can lower the temperature in the model settings.
